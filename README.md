## 📂 Featured Projects

### [Algerian Forest Fire Prediction](https://github.com/ratnesh134/algerian-forest-fire-prediction)
This project predicts the likelihood of forest fires in Algeria using machine learning models. The model uses environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed to make predictions.

### [Banking Document Classification](https://github.com/ratnesh134/banking-document-classification)
Developed an NLP-based machine learning model to identify and classify documents containing sensitive information in the banking sector, improving security and compliance.

### [Cold Email Generator](https://github.com/ratnesh134/cold-email-generator)
Built an AI-powered tool using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI to automate the process of generating personalized cold emails.

### [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/ratnesh134/house-price-prediction)
A neural network model built to predict house prices based on various features like size, location, and amenities. Achieved an R² score of 0.74.

## 🌱 Current Focus

I am currently working on the early stages of building a **start-up** that will leverage cutting-edge **AI** and **machine learning** technologies. I am also looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals on **innovative** projects!
